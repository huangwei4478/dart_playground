## Chapter 1 challenges

You can find challenge answers for future chapters in this folder. However, your challenge this time only involves creating and opening a Dart project, so this folder is empty for Chapter 1.

### Challenge 1

Create a new project in VS Code by yourself and then run it.

### Challenge 2

Open the final project in the supplemental materials. Run **hello.dart** and also **hello_dart_project**.
